# Image Analysis with CLIP and LLM

This project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing images using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) and LLM (Large Language Model) technologies. It processes images in a specified directory, performs various analyses, and saves the results in JSON format.

## Features

- Analyzes images using CLIP in multiple modes (caption, best, fast, classic, negative)
- Processes images with LLM using customizable prompts
- Supports batch processing of images in a directory and its subdirectories
- Implements retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API calls
- Saves analysis results in JSON format for each image
- Generates wildcard text files from existing JSON results
- Implements logging for debugging and monitoring
- Efficiently manages previously processed images to avoid redundant analysis

## How It Works

1. The application scans the specified image directory and its subdirectories for image files.
2. For each image, it checks if a corresponding JSON file already exists.
3. If a JSON file exists, it determines which analysis modes need to be run based on the existing data.
4. The application then performs the required analyses using CLIP and/or LLM.
5. Results are saved in JSON format, either creating a new file or updating an existing one.
6. After processing all images, it generates wildcard text files from the existing JSON results.

## Efficient Processing with JSON Files

The application uses JSON files to keep track of processed images and their analysis results. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Avoiding Redundant Processing**: Before analyzing an image, the system checks for an existing JSON file with the same name as the image (plus the analyzer name). If found, it reads the file to determine which analysis modes have already been performed.

2. **Incremental Updates**: If new analysis modes are enabled or if only some modes were previously processed, the system will only perform the missing analyses. This saves time and computational resources by not repeating work that's already been done.

3. **File Integrity Checking**: The system generates a unique hash for each image file. When an existing JSON file is found, the current image's hash is compared with the stored hash. If they don't match, it indicates the image has been modified, and the system will reprocess the image entirely.

4. **Flexible Result Storage**: The JSON structure allows for storing results from multiple analysis modes and even multiple models for the same mode. This flexibility enables easy comparison and aggregation of results.

5. **Wildcard Generation**: After processing, the system scans all JSON files to generate wildcard text files. These files contain aggregated results for each analysis mode, which can be useful for various downstream tasks or quick overviews of the analysis results.

## JSON File Structure

Each JSON file contains:

- `file_info`: Metadata about the image file (filename, unique hash, creation date, processing date, file size)
- `analysis`: A dictionary of analysis results, with keys for each processed mode
